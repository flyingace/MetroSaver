            <h2>MetroSaver</h2>

            <p>MetroSaver helps you get the most value out of your Pay-Per-Ride MetroCardÂ® when riding the MTA in New
                York City by calculating exactly how much to add to your MetroCard so that every penny on
                your card goes toward your rides.</p>

            <p>MTA Station Booths and MetroCard Vending Machines (MVMs) add an 11% bonus for all MetroCard purchases
                over $5.50. That's great, but sometimes it means you end up with money on your MetroCard that won't be
                enough to purchase another fare.</p>

            <p>Please Note: You can add as little as 1&cent; to your MetroCard at a station booth and if you're
                paying with coins, you can add as little as 5&cent; at an MVM. Since adding money to your MetroCard
                in small amounts is easier to figure out, the results MetroSaver displays are intended for people
                using a credit card to add money to their MetroCard, or for people adding money for multiple rides to
                their MetroCard.</p>

            <h3>How It Works</h3>

            <p>Enter the amount you currently have remaining on your MetroCard, hit the GO button, and MetroSaver
                calculates for you the amount you need to add in order to end up with a balance that can be used
                entirely on your rides.</p>

            <p>If you're paying the standard fare to ride the subways and buses then you don't need to do anything else.
                Riding Express Buses or using a Reduced-Fare MetroCard? Tap the <strong>Settings</strong> button at the
                bottom of the screen, choose your fare and MetroSaver will make all calculations based on the cost of
                your rides.</p>

            <h3>Facts and Figures</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>An 11% bonus will be added any time $5.50 or more is added to a MetroCard.</li>
                <li>The minimum you can add to your MetroCard:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>At a station booth: 1&cent;</li>
                    <li>At a MetroCard Vending Machine (MVM): 5&cent;</li>
                </ul>
                <li>The maximum you can add to your MetroCard:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>At a station booth: $80</li>
                    <li>At a MVM: $100 (including the 11% bonus)</li>
                </ul>
                <li>The greatest balance you can carry on your MetroCard: $100.00</li>

                <li>Subway and Local Bus Fare</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Standard: $2.75</li>
                    <li>Reduced-Fare: $1.35</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Express Bus Fare</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Standard: $6.50</li>
                    <li>Reduced (Off-Peak Only): $3.25</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h3>No Results</h3>

            <p>If you've hit the GO button and you&apos;re seeing &quot;No Results,&quot; it probably means that the
                amount you have entered as your current balance cannot have money added to it at a MetroCard Vending
                Machine and return a result evenly divisible by the fare you have selected. For possible reasons why,
                have a look at <strong>Facts and Figures</strong> above. If you want to add amount of money to your
                MetroCard that you can't add on a MetroCard Vending Machine, you can do so at a station booth, so
                long as it won't put your total over $100.</p>
